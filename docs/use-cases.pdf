## Use Case 1: Payroll for Unbanked Workers

### The Problem

**Scenario:** Construction company in Sub-Saharan Africa employs 500 day laborers.

**Traditional Banking Challenges:**
- 60% of workers lack bank accounts
- Opening accounts requires days of paperwork
- Wire transfers cost $5-15 per transaction
- Cash payments create security and theft risks
- Workers spend hours traveling to collect wages

**Current Workarounds:**
- Mobile money (high fees: 2-5%)
- Cash payments (security risks)
- Delayed payments (workers wait days)

### Bridgelet Solution

**Implementation Timeline:**

```
Week 1: Setup
├── Employer integrates Bridgelet SDK
├── Configures USDC funding account
└── Tests with 10 pilot workers

Week 2: First Payroll
├── Employer creates 500 ephemeral accounts
├── SMS sent to each worker with claim link
├── Workers claim funds within 24-48 hours
└── 85% claim rate in first week

Month 2-3: Optimization
├── Claim rate increases to 95%
├── Workers with wallets receive direct payments
└── New hires still use ephemeral accounts
```

**Monthly Process Flow:**

```
Day 30 (End of Month):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. HR uploads payroll spreadsheet   │
│    (500 workers, amounts, phones)   │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. System creates 500 ephemeral     │
│    accounts (~5 minutes)            │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. SMS sent to all workers:         │
│    "Your $250 salary is ready!      │
│     Claim: https://claim.../xyz"    │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               ▼
Day 30-32: Workers claim
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 4. Worker opens link on phone       │
│ 5. Connects wallet (or creates new) │
│ 6. Funds instantly swept to wallet  │
│ 7. Worker can spend/save freely     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Traditional fintech requires pre-existing accounts
- Must maintain transparency for donors/regulators

### Bridgelet Solution

**Implementation Timeline:**

```
