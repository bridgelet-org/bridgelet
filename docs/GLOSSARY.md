# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Bridgelet project and the Stellar ecosystem.
It is intended to help new users and contributors quickly understand domain-specific concepts.

Terms are listed alphabetically and may be expanded over time as the project evolves.

---

## Asset Issuer
The Stellar account that creates and issues a custom asset (token).
The issuer controls the total supply and authorization rules for the asset.

*Example:* A USDC issuer account issues USDC tokens on Stellar.

See also: **Trustline**, **Stellar Account**

---

## Auto-sweep
An automated process that transfers funds out of an account once certain conditions are met,
such as reaching a balance threshold or nearing expiration.

*Example:* Automatically sweeping XLM from an ephemeral account to a destination wallet.

See also: **Sweep**, **Ephemeral Account**

---

## Base Reserve
The minimum amount of XLM required to maintain a Stellar account and its associated entries
(trustlines, offers, signers).

*Example:* Each trustline increases the base reserve requirement.

See also: **XLM (Lumens)**, **Trustline**

---

## Claim Token
A token generated by Bridgelet that allows a user to claim funds or assets.

*Example:* A user receives a claim token via email to access funds without a pre-existing wallet.

See also: **Claim URL**, **Expiry**

---

## Claim URL
A URL containing a claim token that enables a user to claim funds through a web or app interface.

*Example:* Clicking a claim URL opens Bridgelet’s claim flow.

See also: **Claim Token**

---

## Destination Wallet
The wallet where claimed or swept funds are ultimately sent.

*Example:* A user’s personal Stellar wallet receiving claimed assets.

See also: **Stellar Account**

---

## Ephemeral Account
A temporary Stellar account created for short-lived use cases such as claims or onboarding.
Typically designed to be emptied and closed after use.

See also: **Auto-sweep**, **Expiry**

## Expiry / Expiration
The time after which a claim, token, or account is no longer valid.

*Example:* A claim token expires after 7 days if not used.

## Funding Account
A Stellar account used to fund other accounts, often providing the minimum XLM balance
required for account creation.
