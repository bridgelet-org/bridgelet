# Bridgelet Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant 2.1 and reflects the expectations of the Bridgelet community.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in the Bridgelet community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment
- Showing empathy and respect for other people and their viewpoints
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Prioritizing community well-being over individual wins
- Redirecting conversations that veer off-topic without dismissing people
- Acknowledging mistakes and focusing on solutions

### Examples of unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, stalking, or intimidation in any form
- Offensive or derogatory comments related to protected characteristics
- Trolling, deliberate misinformation, or derailing discussions
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Sustained disruption of meetings, code reviews, issues, or pull requests

## Scope

This Code applies within all Bridgelet community spaces (repositories, discussions, issues, pull requests, documentation, and events) and when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness a violation:
- Prefer email: `aminubabafatima8@gmail.com` (private and monitored by the core maintainers)
- If email is not possible, open a confidential issue marked with the `code-of-conduct` label and note that sensitive details will be shared privately
- For urgent safety concerns, also consider contacting relevant local authorities

Reports should include: what happened, where it happened (links if possible), when it occurred, and who was involved. Reports will be acknowledged within 3 business days.

## Enforcement Process

1. **Intake and acknowledgement** – A maintainer reviews the report, acknowledges receipt, and may request additional detail.
2. **Assessment** – Maintainers evaluate context, consult any involved parties, and determine whether the Code was violated.
3. **Decision and action** – Maintainers apply the guidelines below, documenting rationale and scope.
4. **Communication** – The reporter receives a summary of the outcome where appropriate, respecting privacy and safety.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will use these guidelines to determine consequences for violations:

### 1. Correction
- **Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional
- **Consequence:** A private, written warning with clarity on expected behavior

### 2. Warning
- **Impact:** A single incident or pattern of inappropriate behavior after correction
- **Consequence:** A private warning and possible temporary participation limits

### 3. Temporary Ban
- **Impact:** Sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or escalation after warnings
- **Consequence:** Temporary ban from community spaces and contribution channels

### 4. Permanent Ban
- **Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of abuse, harassment, or threatening safety
- **Consequence:** Permanent removal from all community spaces and contribution channels

## Appeals

If you believe an action was taken in error, you may appeal by replying to the enforcement communication or by emailing `aminubabafatima8@gmail.com` with additional context. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original decision when possible.
