# Bridgelet Support Guide

Use this guide to choose the right channel and set expectations for getting help with Bridgelet.

## Channels and When to Use Them

- **GitHub Issues** (`https://github.com/bridgelet-org/bridgelet/issues`): Bugs, regressions, incorrect docs, build failures, reproducible crashes. Please avoid using issues for general questions.
- **GitHub Discussions** (`https://github.com/bridgelet-org/bridgelet/discussions`): How-to questions, architecture and design feedback, integration patterns, feature requests, roadmap discussion.
- **Documentation** (`./docs`): Start with the Architecture Overview, Getting Started, Integration Guide, and the [FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md) before opening a new thread.
- **Community channels:** None are active yet. Watch the repository or Discussions for announcements when a chat/real-time channel is opened.
- **Email (sensitive or private topics):** `aminubabafatima8@gmail.com` for security concerns, private incidents, or when public channels are inappropriate. For vulnerabilities, follow the steps in `SECURITY.md` and do not open a public issue.
- **Commercial support:** Not offered today. For partnership inquiries, email `aminubabafatima8@gmail.com` with context.

## Expected Response Times

- Issues: triage within **3 business days**; critical regressions are prioritized.
- Discussions: initial reply within **3-5 business days**.
- Email (sensitive topics): acknowledgement within **3 business days**.
- Security reports: acknowledgement within **48 hours** as described in `SECURITY.md`.

## How to Ask Good Questions

- Describe the goal, what you tried, and where it failed.
- Provide reproducible steps or a minimal code snippet/repo if possible.
- Include environment details (OS, language/runtime versions, dependencies) and logs or error messages.
- State expected vs. actual behavior and any workarounds you attempted.
- Add relevant links to docs, issues, or discussions you already reviewed.

## Troubleshooting Checklist (before filing)

- Confirm you are on the latest released version or commit you are targeting.
- Re-read the relevant section of the docs and the [FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md) to ensure the behavior is expected.
- Check open and closed issues/discussions for similar reports.
- Run tests or a minimal reproduction to isolate the problem scope.
- Collect logs and sanitize sensitive data before sharing.

## Where to Start

If you are unsure which channel to use, open a GitHub Discussion with a short summary. Maintainers can help redirect you.
